	<h1>Four Creatures with Wisdom for Success</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>It is common with men to expect success only from things that appears too strong, places with good reputation or persons with good academic or social background. But God always override such human expectations with things, places or persons with nothing to write home about.</p>
			<p>In this article, you will be introduced to four codes of wisdom that are very successful</p>

    <h2>The Ants</h2>

			<p>The ants are very successful creature by themselves. And success is not possible without wisdom. Let's take a look on how the ants demonstrates wisdom to gather their food;</p>
			<ul>	   
				<li>First, the ants understands their weakness as small in size, slow in speed and begins early to gather and store their food for the future.</li>
				<li>The ants also know their strength which is their nose that they use to sense food particules, oil, deadd ants and more. The ants can be totally absent on a surface or room but once food particles drops the ants shows up from nowhere.</li>
				<li>The ants are very focus in their mission, they keep line/path from the food source direct to their store. The ants do not give up at obstruction on their path or on change in the food position - they quickly reorganize, communicate and coontinue.</li>
				<li>The ants are people of unity. Unity helps the work together without director of labour, unity helps the ants to patiently drag big food into their store.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>These are some ways the ants live that they have become success example and qualified to be imitated.</p>

    <h2>The Conies</h2>

			<p>The conies are small animals, their size is similar to that of rabbit but by nature lives in rocks a hustle environment where smart predators like eagles patrol. Inspite the surrounding enemies around the conies they keep succeeding and are good example of success by the security strategies they apply as follow:</p>
			<ul>
	      <li>They acknowldege that they are surrounded by enemies that are very smart to attack.</li>
		    <li>They live in hole, small for their size that their surrounding enemies cannot pass into.</li>
				<li>They made their hole in the rock: which is so strong that their enemies cannot break to attack.</li>
				<li>The conies come out in group: at least one  must be on the watch at all direction in the case of their enemies.</li>
	    </ul>
			<p>Therefore, to succeed you must live like the conies. Acknowledge enemies exist.</p>
			<p><span>Note: </span>enemies are not competiors. Enemies are destroyers, terminators, bastardizers etc.</p>
			<p>Be security conscious like the conies.</p>

    <h2>The Locusts</h2>
		<img src="./Assets/locusts_1.jpg" alt="locusts matching">
			<p>The locust are small creature. Their ability to coordinate themselves when changing environment without a commander, no dispute, or the strong flying faster than the weak. No doubt for any kind of human groups such as family, business, community and other groups to succeed; the locust unity are good example to emulate. Becuase division in a house will not enable achievement of any goal. Now the locust travels in the following order:</p>
	    <ul>
				<li>A destination (goal)</li>
				<li>Large number</li>
				<li>Long distance</li>
				<li>Takeoff at once</li>
				<li>No turning back</li>
				<li>Leaves no member behind</li>
				<li>Arrives at same times.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span>Note: </span>Being in midst of the crowd does not misbehave people, you just display what you are.</p>
			<p>Therefore, let families, communities, nations, teams, group businesses, colleagues and more imitate the locust attributes for success.</p>

			<p>The spider is a smalll creature. The spider lives in web made by themselves. The spider makes a building dirty. But whenit comes to success we have somewhat to learn from the spider such as:</p>
	    <ul>
				<li>The best: the spider settles most on finised buildings.</li>
				<li>Recommendation: spiders do not wait for recommendation for the placd they had found to move.</li>
				<li>Invitation: who would have invited spider to his house but because the house have</li>
				<li>Permission: all protocols not observed says spider. Sometimes you waste much time just for permission.</li>
				<li>Patience: the spider builds or rebuilts her web with patience</li>
